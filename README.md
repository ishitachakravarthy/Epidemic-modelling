# Epidemic-modelling
Epidemics and optimal vaccination strategies on sociocentric networks

- Implemented a stochastic SIR-V model using the Gillespie algorithm in MATLAB to predict early warning indicators
for transitions between physical and social dynamics of an epidemic
- Integrated Mutual Information and Join Counts as early warning signals with a graphical approach
- Applied Geary’s C and Moran’s I coefficients for spatial analysis, uncovering actionable insights for resource allocation
